PlugY must be installed first (make sure to use Installer version of PlugY, not ZIP archive)
Glide Wrapper is also required (but you can still run in DirectDraw mode when windowed)

1. Put this into your diablo 2 folder
D2HD.dll must be in the same folder as files such Game.exe and D2Data.MPQ
Mod PlugY folder should be merged with your existing Mod PlugY folder
2. Go to mod PlugY folder, and edit the PlugY.ini file
Near the start of the file where it says "DllToLoad=", write "D2HD.dll"; i.e. like this:

DllToLoad=D2HD.dll

IMPORTANT: if you have already put BaseMod.dll in thise line, use next property instead: DllToLoad2; like this:

DllToLoad2=D2HD.dll

Then save the file.

3. After launching Diablo 2 and entering the game, go to video settings and change the resolution

Notes:
1) Game may crash when changing resolution. This is only when you change resolution, so just restart it once.
2) When using this mod without PoD loot filter, 2 consecutive errors appear when closing the game. As far as I know they can be safely ignored.
