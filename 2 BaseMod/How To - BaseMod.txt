PlugY must be installed first (make sure to use Installer version of PlugY, not ZIP archive)

1. Put this into your diablo 2 folder
BaseMod.dll must be in the same folder as files such Game.exe and D2Data.MPQ
Mod PlugY folder should be merged with your existing Mod PlugY folder
2. Go to mod PlugY folder, and edit the PlugY.ini file
Near the start of the file where it says "DllToLoad=", write "BaseMod.dll"; i.e. like this:

DllToLoad=BaseMod.dll

Note: if you have already used DllToLoad for Widescreen support (D2HD.dll), instead use DllToLoad2, like this:

DllToLoad2=BaseMod.dll

Then save the file.
