1. Copy to your Diablo 2 folder. Merge the Mod PlugY folder with your existing folder.
2. Go to Mod PlugY and edit the PlugY.ini file
Right at the start of the file under [LAUNCHING], where it says "Param=", append to the end "-direct -txt", like this:

Param= -direct -txt

NOTE: If you already have -direct -txt here, no need to make changes.
NOTE: You may have other settings here, like -3dfx, -sndbkg, -w and so on.
Just concatenate all this together, but make sure there is space before each dash. Order doesn't matter
Examples:

Param= -w -direct -txt

Param= -direct -txt -sndbkg

Param= -3dfx -direct -txt -sndbkg
