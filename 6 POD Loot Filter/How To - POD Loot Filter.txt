1. Make a backup of the Fog.dll file in case you need to uninstall this.
2. Copy to your Diablo 2 folder. 
Following files go in the root Diablo 2 folder (Where Game.exe and D2Data.mpq files are):
- D2PodClient.dll
- Fog.dll
- pod.dll
- pod.cfg
- UI.ini
Folder "Mod PlugY" should be merged with your existing folder

NOTE: If you have manually changed character (save) file location via registry edit, this will discard those changes.
If you change save file location via PlugY (via ActiveSaveFileChange setting), the game will not start.

Instead, use Mod PlugY\config\config.cfg text file to change save file location, like this:
\Save Path\="C:\\Users\\ubeogesh\\OneDrive\\Games\\D2Saves"

Note the double slashes, they are needed to work.
