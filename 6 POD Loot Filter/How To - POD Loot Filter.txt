1. Make a backup of the Fog.dll file in case you need to uninstall this.
2. Copy to your Diablo 2 folder. 
Following files go in the root Diablo 2 folder (Where Game.exe and D2Data.mpq files are):
- D2PodClient.dll
- Fog.dll
- pod.dll
- pod.cfg
- UI.ini
Folder "Mod PlugY" should be merged with your existing folder

NOTE: If you have manually changed character (save) file location via registry edit, this will discard those changes.
Instead, change save file location via PlugY.ini file
